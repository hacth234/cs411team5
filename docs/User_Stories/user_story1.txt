Finding Class Number user story
As a user or a guest I would want to be able to view the class name given a class number code i.e. cs411 -> Gives back Software Engineering with Donham and its associated records.
Vice Versa typing in a class name or some parts of the class name will bring back and its associated data objects. i.e. Soft… -> autofills cs411 associated records
There is also an “advanced search” option where the user would be able to search	by the college or department code the class belongs to. 
Choosing “CAS” should show the department/subject codes that belong to CAS. Choosing the department code should in turn display the class codes.
