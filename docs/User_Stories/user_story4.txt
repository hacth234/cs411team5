Viewing professors/write reviews for a professor
As a logged in user, I can input a professor’s name and see ratings, reviews for this professor. 
The source would be RateMyProfessor, past reviews in our app. 
There will be an option to vote for a review as “helpful”, and displayed reviews will be in order of most “helpful” to least. After, the reviews will be sorted chronologically (newest to oldest).
I also have the option to write a review and rate this professor. There is a text box at the bottom of the page, where I can type my review.
As a guest user, I would not have the option to write a review or rate the professor.
