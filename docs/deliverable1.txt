Idea 5:
Corona Nearby app 
(data)API: https://covidtracking.com/data/api, google news api and locational api.
https://developers.google.com/android/exposure-notifications/exposure-notifications-api?p=exposure_notifications_update&visit_id=637491235178403741-4012966233&rd=2
Third party OAuth: facebook, google, etc.

Using the corona tracking api we can pull data from covid tracking api. Using this information
we can pull information about the places and how severe the covid is in that area.
We can then also use locational tracking api based on giving your OAuth data from
facebook or google whether you have been into these exposed area or not. Prompting 
user to give permission to use locational data comes first. We can use firebase to
handle storing future locational footprint for the user that gave by cross referencing
use a newly made cookie for the user and the OAuth sign in. Doing all this we can give an
indicator in the app for the user's own threat level and surrouding threat level on google maps.
