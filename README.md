##IMPORTANT FILES SUBMITTED FOR FINAL PROJECT: In "FinalProject" directory <br />
##Most of the older documentation files are updated in this directory also. <br />
The deployed heroku website for our Final Web App RecipeAlert:  <br />
https://fierce-bastion-88171.herokuapp.com/ <br />
<br />

Here we have two submitted project versions:  <br />
One deployed on heroku and one for local hosting. For the best testing experience with the code: test on local host but either will work.  <br />
Some image icons are missing if using https://fierce-bastion-88171.herokuapp.com/ for testing.  <br />
All the requirements are in the pipfile and was configured accordingly every time with: pipenv install "package_name"  <br />

Two project zip files:  <br />
(Choose local_host for local host testing otherwise just use the website https://fierce-bastion-88171.herokuapp.com/  <br />
For only code review and the cleanest version of the code just review recipealertv1_oauthheroku.zip both of them has the same functionality but recipealertv1_oauthheroku.zip is more updated with better comments ):  <br />
